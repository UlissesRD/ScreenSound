The program is about various sorting and filtering methods in C# on a very extensive list of songs.

## Prerequisites 🔧

To run the project, you need to have an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and Java installed and configured on your machine.

The project was built using version 19.0.2 of the Java SE Development Kit from Oracle.

It's worth noting that this project was developed and tested on the Windows operating system.

If you don't have Java installed, please visit the Oracle website for installation:
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk19-archive-downloads.html

If you don't have an IDE, you can choose one according to your preference, but I recommend one of these two:
- IntelliJ: https://www.jetbrains.com/pt-br/idea/download/?section=windows
- VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

### Operation⚙️

I've already prepared some commented tests in the 'Program' class.

In the 'LinqFilter' class, we have all the filters.

In the 'LinqOrder' class, we have all the sorting methods.

In the 'FavoriteSongs' class, we have the creation of the favorite songs list, adding songs to that list, and creating a JSON file from that list.

In the 'Song' class, we have the details of a song's classifications.

### Observations🔎

The initial list of songs was not created by me; you can find it on Guilherme's profile (https://github.com/guilhermeonrails) via the link:
